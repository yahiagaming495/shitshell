# shitshell
A shell made for people who hate their lives
-----------

**DISCLAIMER: This shell was a hard project to do, Especially for me as a beginner. I asked AI to clarify to me what everything means. So of course this shell is not and will not be perfect. Please report bugs to the bugs section on this repo**

Now with that disclaimer said, Let's clarify what this shell can and can't do

This shell can:
- Run commands
  
- Store command history for the current session to navigate between commands (Using GNU readline)

- Run "cd" and "exit" commands

- Run third-party applications

This shell can't:

- Do piping

- Say which directory it is in (like zsh)

- Be customized at all

- All other features that is NOT in the lisk of what the shell can do
